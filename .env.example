# Environment Variables Example
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your actual values
# Never commit .env.local or any actual environment variables to version control
# ⚠️ These values are EXPOSED to the frontend - do not store sensitive secrets here

# Portfolio Configuration
VITE_APP_NAME=Parth Azad Portfolio
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com

# Email Configuration (EmailJS - see https://www.emailjs.com/)
# ⚠️ These values are PUBLIC - they're used in the browser
# Even though exposed, EmailJS service prevents abuse through domain whitelisting
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_xxxxxxxxx
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_xxxxxxxxx
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=public_key_xxxxx

# Analytics (if using Google Analytics)
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
# 1. Only VITE_ prefixed variables are exposed to the frontend (bundle)
# 2. Never store actual secrets (API keys, passwords) with VITE_ prefix
# 3. Backend-only credentials should NOT have VITE_ prefix
# 4. Each variable should be configured separately in Vercel dashboard:
#    Settings > Environment Variables (Add these one by one)
# 5. For EmailJS: Domain whitelist your production URL in EmailJS settings
# 6. Always test with .env.local first before deploying
